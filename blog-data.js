   blog-data.js : the one file you edit to update the NEWSLETTER parts
   of the blog (index segments + series.html). Essay cards stay as
   plain HTML in blogs.html.
   - Add an edition: add one line to the right section's editions.
   - tagline: the short line shown beside the name on the My Blogs page.
   - flat: true = one plain list of editions (no series rows) on the My Blogs page.
   - Add a series/bridge: add a section. Add a newsletter: add an entry.
   - url "" = shows as plain text (no link yet). A url like "SignalSheet_E2.html"
     opens that page on this site; a url starting with https:// opens in a new tab.
